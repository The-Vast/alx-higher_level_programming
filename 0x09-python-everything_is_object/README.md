# Python - Everything is object
## Background Context
Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, letâ€™s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.
## Learning Objectives
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is an object
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* What is a reference
* What is an assignment
* What is an alias
* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
* What is mutable and immutable
* What are the built-in mutable types
* What are the built-in immutable types
* How does Python pass variables to functions
## Tasks
0. Who am I?
What function would you use to print the type of an object?

Write the name of the function in the file, without ().
1. Where are you?
How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?

Write the name of the function in the file, without ().
2. Right count
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
3. Right count =
